The aim of this project is to make a suitable game that utilized the process of random generation while learning the language of C++. However, I fell very short of finishing this project. The main reason for the failure of this project was not realizing the complexity of the runtime logic and being unable to achieve my desired results vs what sdl is actually capable of.

The essential development libries are listed below: 
build-essential libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libboost-dev

The environment I am working on this project in is Ubuntu 12.11

Perlin Noise.cpp and Perlin Noise.h were not created by me, thier author is listed in their source code.
